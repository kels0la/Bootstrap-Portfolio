                <p>Let's get this awkward talking about myself thing out of the way... Well, I'll start by telling you that
                    I'm 31 years old with a Bachelors degree in Accounting. After graduating, I worked for a company that
                    serviced private schools across the country. I started off as a temp, was hired on as a full-time customer
                    service representative, and was promoted to the Tuition Management Lead position - which was essentially
                    the Billing Supervisor.</p>
                <p>Under this role, I was responsible for managing the direction and workflow of the department. I maintained
                    ongoing relationships with the main clients. I created the training program for the Admissions, Enrollment,
                    and Tuition Management departments and trained over 20 employees with it. I wrote the Tuition Management
                    Policies and Procedure manual, and directly led a group of 3-5 employees specialized in my department.
                    And lastly, I wrote over 50 tickets to our web development team with the purpose of improving my product
                    line and website interface/functionality.</p>

                <p>After I left this position, I entered a period of self-discovery where I lived off of my savings and investment
                    earnings. During this time, I read books related to entrepreneurship, human relations, marketing, business,
                    and differentiation. I started going to the gym frequently and mastered the art of eating healthy (I
                    even used my spreadsheet skills to figure out how to hit the 100% Daily Value for each vitamin and mineral
                    using only natural foods without supplements). I discovered a passion for writing, and paired this passion
                    with another passion of mine: Bitcoin. </p>

                <p>And now, I'm taking my prior knowledge, leadership experience, passion for Bitcoin, and pairing it with coding.
                    Web development is a skill I've always wanted, and I finally pulled the trigger with this class. I'm
                    excited to see where it takes me.</p>
